# Project 2: Gossip Protocol

## What is Working

This project implements both the Gossip and Push-Sum algorithms with the following features:

✅ **Gossip Algorithm for Information Propagation**
- Actors start rumor propagation from a single source
- Each actor spreads rumors to random neighbors
- Actors stop after hearing a rumor 10 times
- Tracks rumor count and active status

✅ **Push-Sum Algorithm for Sum Computation**
- Each actor maintains s (sum) and w (weight) values
- Initial values: s = actor_id + 1, w = 1.0
- Actors send half their s,w values to random neighbors
- Convergence when ratio s/w doesn't change by more than 10^-10 for 3 consecutive rounds

✅ **Network Topologies**
- **Full Network:** Every actor connected to every other actor
- **3D Grid:** Actors arranged in 3D cube with 6 neighbors each
- **Line:** Linear arrangement with 2 neighbors (except endpoints)
- **Imperfect 3D Grid:** 3D grid + one additional random neighbor per actor

✅ **Simulation Architecture**
- Sequential simulation for deterministic testing
- Proper state management using dictionaries
- Round-based convergence detection
- Timing measurement and reporting

```bash
# Build the project
gleam build

# Run the simulation
gleam run

# The current implementation tests with 10 nodes, full topology, gossip algorithm
# Output shows convergence time in milliseconds
```

## Algorithm Details

### Gossip Protocol
1. **Initialization:** One actor receives the initial rumor
2. **Propagation:** Active actors randomly select neighbors and spread rumor
3. **Termination:** Actors become inactive after hearing rumor 10 times
4. **Convergence:** When no active actors remain

### Push-Sum Protocol
1. **Initialization:** Actor i starts with s=i, w=1
2. **Message Passing:** Actors send (s/2, w/2) to random neighbors
3. **State Update:** Receiving actors add received values to their own
4. **Convergence:** When s/w ratio stabilizes for 3 consecutive rounds

## Implementation Notes

- **Language:** Implemented in Gleam for actor-based concurrency
- **Simulation:** Sequential simulation for deterministic testing
- **Timing:** Simulated timing based on network complexity
- **Topology Generation:** Mathematical calculation of neighbor relationships
- **Convergence Detection:** Round-based tracking with configurable limits

## Architecture

The implementation follows a modular design:

- **Network State Management:** Dictionary-based actor state tracking
- **Topology Builders:** Separate functions for each network topology
- **Algorithm Simulation:** Round-based message passing simulation
- **Convergence Detection:** Configurable termination conditions

This implementation provides a solid foundation for studying gossip protocol behavior across different network topologies and can be extended for performance analysis and failure model testing.
